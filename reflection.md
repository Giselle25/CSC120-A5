- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
My initial thoughts were that it was straight foward. It seems straightfoward looking at it from an outsider perspective, but working on code yourself makes you think more deeply about the associations between different classes. 
My initial impression 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Taking breaks during coding helped. I got stuck a couple times and giving my eyes a break helped me catch errors more quickly. I had made a small error that I could not figure out but taking a break, helped me get a fresh look at my code. Running the class codes individually also helped to fix small errrors, instead working from the main.
